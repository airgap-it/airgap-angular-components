# AirGap Angular Components

A set of Angular libraries providing utilities, UI components and services used across various [AirGap](https://airgap.it/) projects.

## Overview

The project is split into the following packages:

The `core` package consists of numerous utility functions and types as well as Angular components and services that can be used standalone or as a base for more specific implementations.
